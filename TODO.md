# TODO
- [ ] Cancel delete - Provide user options to cancel after selected either delete by index or 
      delete by name.
- [ ] Drill down - Enable ability to drill down into a repository. Would like to see project 
      structure last commit message, and primary contributor (e.g. who has contributed the most).
